the first ai round trys to establish a frim name and likely website fro leads who have no real attorney email
and no law office field. 

firms that dont get any hits in apollo will be given the redirect follow method

ok first never use emojies and whatsgoing on with this 855mikewins? are we not parsing the string properly? 
 Domain mismatch: 855mikewins.com vs 855mikewins.com kymberly.debler
